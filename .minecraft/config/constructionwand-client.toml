#This is the Client config for ConstructionWand.
#If you're not familiar with Forge's new split client/server config, let me explain:
#Client config is stored in the /config folder and only contains client specific settings like graphics and keybinds.
#Mod behavior is configured in the Server config, which is world-specific and thus located
#in the /saves/myworld/serverconfig folder. If you want to change the serverconfig for all
#new worlds, copy the config files in the /defaultconfigs folder.
